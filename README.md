# Spectral_Flow_Workflow

This script is an addition to doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2021.768113. We will walk through the described pipeline with two different spectral flow cytometry datasets. Case A will use the dataset described in the paper and available at: https://flowrepository.org/id/FR-FCM-Z4KT . Case B will use part of the files of a spectral flow cytometry dataset https://flowrepository.org/experiments/3675. Files to download from this dataset are the healthy controls. 

If there are difficulties adapting the script to your own dataset, please do not hestitate to contact us: h.denbraanker@erasmusmc.nl or github.
